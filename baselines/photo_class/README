This baseline demonstrates how AstroPile data sets can be used with existing software, namely the snmachine package from LSST/DESC.
Their package is pip installable, but contains several bugs that led to failed unit tests.
The ado8/snmachine fork is intended to patch these issues.
snmachine can work with pymultinest if MultiNest and Cuba libraries are available, but this demonstration does not require pymultinest.

snmachine_example.py contains functions for converting AstroPile data into the format expected by snmachine, perform basic data pre-processing (cleaning padding, clipping light curves around a rough guess of tmax, shifting time to min(time)=0), and wrap snmachine feature extraction and classification.
The data format conversion takes time, so results are stored in snmachine_dset.pickle after its run the first time.

The demonstration can be run as
$python snmachine_example.py
and will perform wavelet feature extraction and classification.
The salt_classification variable can be set to True if wanted.
