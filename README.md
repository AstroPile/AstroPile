## How To Contribute

### Code Style

The code should follow the standard [PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). This is enforced by using the [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) code linter and formatter. 

To help with maintaining compliance with the format, we provide a `pre-commit` hook that automatically runs `ruff` on the modified code. To install and learn more about `pre-commit`, please refer to [the official documentation](https://pre-commit.com/).
