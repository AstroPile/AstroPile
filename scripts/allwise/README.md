# AllWISE

This folder contains a dataset for the AllWISE Source Catalog, which provides all-sky mid-IR photometry in the WISE W1, W2, W3, and W4 bands at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 Î¼m, along with position and apparent motion information for 747 million sources.

For more information on AllWISE, see https://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/sec1_1.html.

For more information on the Source Catalog, see https://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/sec2_1.html, and particular https://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/sec2_1a.html for details on the format and columns.

## Data Preparation

The data can be downloaded using the `download_parts.py` script, which will grab the AllWISE data in Parquet format. This is already partitioned into a healpix k=5 (nside=32) Parquet dataset, which you can immediately load into Huggingface datasets with `datasets.load_dataset(...)`. However, for consistency with the rest of the datasets in AstroPile, we prepare it into HDF5 files partitioned by healpix at k=4 (nside=16). This is done by running `healpixify.py`, which repartitions the Parquet files, and then `to_hdf5.py`, which will convert the Parquet files into HDF5 files. As an example of the full preparation, you can see the `test.sh` script.
