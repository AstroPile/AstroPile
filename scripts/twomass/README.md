# 2MASS

This folder contains a dataset for the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), which provides all-sky near-IR photometry in the J, H, and Ks bands at 1.235, 1.662, and 2.159 Î¼m. Current there is support for the Point Source Catalog, which consists of over 500 million stars and galaxies.

For more information on 2MASS, see https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/overview/about2mass.html and https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/doc/explsup.html.

For more information on the Point Source Catalog, see https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/doc/sec2_2.html, and particular https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/doc/sec2_2a.html for details on the format and columns.

## Data Preparation

The data can be downloaded using the `download_parts.py` script, which will grab the 2MASS PSC data in gzipped csv format. You can then run the `to_parquet.py` script, which will read in all the gzipped csv files, turn them into PyArrow tables, add a healpix column for partitioning, and then merge everything into a partitioned Parquet dataset. This can be used with HF dataset directly. Running `to_hdf5.py`, will convert the Parquet files into HDF5 files, after which you can use the `twomass.py` descriptor to load the files into HF datasets. As an example of the full preparation, you can see the `test.sh` script.
